Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
    I consulted with Etta Applefeld and Tanisha Chetty (after they submitted their assignment). I also talked to Miriam Pennock, who isn't taking the class currently but has taken it previously.
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
    I attended TA hours on Tuesday, February 18th 
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    It definitely feels like learning a new language, like I know what I want to say but it takes a lot of effort to translate it from my brain (which is kind of thinking in python) to Java. But the language doesn't seem too crazy, and hopefully after continuing to practice with it, it will start to come easier.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages?
    A conclusion I can draw is that there are a lot of different ways to approach programming, and different mindsets with which to think about problems, and therefore different ways to solve any problem.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    Again, talking to people worked, and going to TA hours was helpful.
